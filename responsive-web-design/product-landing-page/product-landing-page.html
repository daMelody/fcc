      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Adeimantus complains that the guardians in the just city will not be very happy (419a).
          Socrates points out that the aim is to make the whole city, and not any particular class,
          as happy as possible (420b). Socrates discusses several other measures for the city as a
          whole in order to accomplish this. There should be neither too much wealth nor too much
          poverty in the city since these cause social strife (421d-422a). The just city should be
          only as large in size as would permit it to be unified and stable (423b). Socrates
          reemphasizes the importance of the guardian’s education and suggests that the guardians
          will possess wives and children in common (423e). He suggests that they should only allow
          very limited ways by which innovations may be introduced to education or change in the
          laws (424b-425e). The just city will follow traditional Greek religious customs (427b).

          With the founding of the just city completed, Socrates proceeds to discuss justice (427d).
          He claims that the city they have founded is completely good and virtuous and thus it is
          wise, courageous, moderate, and just (427e). Justice will be what remains once they find
          the other three virtues in it, namely wisdom, courage, and moderation (428a). The wisdom
          of the just city is found in its rulers and it is the type of knowledge that allows them
          to rule the city well (428b-d). The courage of the just city is found in its military and
          it is correct and lawful belief about what to fear and what not to fear (429a-430b). The
          city’s moderation or self-discipline is its unanimity in following the just city’s
          structure in terms of who should rule and who should be ruled (430d-432a). The city’s
          justice consists in each class performing its proper function (433a-b).

          Socrates then proceeds to find the corresponding four virtues in the individual (434d).
          Socrates defends the analogy of the city and the individual (435a-b) and proceeds to
          distinguish three analogous parts in the soul with their natural functions (436b). By
          using instances of psychological conflict, he distinguishes the function of the rational
          part from that of the appetitive part of the soul (439a). Then he distinguishes the
          function of the spirited part from the functions of the two other parts (439e-440e). The
          function of the rational part is thinking, that of the spirited part the experience of
          emotions, and that of the appetitive part the pursuit of bodily desires. Socrates explains
          the virtues of the individual’s soul and how they correspond to the virtues of the city
          (441c-442d). Socrates points out that one is just when each of the three parts of the soul
          performs its function (442d). Justice is a natural balance of the soul’s parts and
          injustice is an imbalance of the parts of the soul (444e). Socrates is now ready to answer
          the question of whether justice is more profitable than injustice that goes unpunished
          (444e-445a). To do so he will need to examine the various unjust political regimes and the
          corresponding unjust individuals in each (445c-e).</p>
