        <p>Haskell is a general purpose, purely functional programming language incorporating many
          recent innovations in programming language design. Haskell provides higher-order
          functions, non-strict semantics, static polymorphic typing, user-defined algebraic
          datatypes, pattern-matching, list comprehensions, a module system, a monadic I/O system,
          and a rich set of primitive datatypes, including lists, arrays, arbitrary and fixed
          precision integers, and floating-point numbers. Haskell is both the culmination and
          solidification of many years of research on non-strict functional languages.</p>
        <p>This report defines the syntax for Haskell programs and an informal abstract semantics
          for the meaning of such programs. We leave as implementation dependent the ways in which
          Haskell programs are to be manipulated, interpreted, compiled, etc. This includes such
          issues as the nature of programming environments and the error messages returned for
          undefined programs (i.e. programs that formally evaluate to ⊥).</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Program_Structure">
        <header>Program Structure</header>
        <p>In this section, we describe the abstract syntactic and semantic structure of Haskell, as
          well as how it relates to the organization of the rest of the report.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>At the topmost level a Haskell program is a set of <i>modules</i>, described in
            Chapter 5. Modules provide a way to control namespaces and to re-use software in large
            programs.
          </li>
          <li>The top level of a module consists of a collection of <i>declarations</i>, of which
            there are several kinds, all described in Chapter 4. Declarations define things such as
            ordinary
            values, datatypes, type classes, and fixity information.</li>
          <li>At the next lower level are <i>expressions</i>, described in Chapter 3. An expression
            denotes a value and has a static type; expressions are at the heart of Haskell
            programming “in the small.”</li>
          <li>At the bottom level is Haskell’s <i>lexical structure</i>, defined in Chapter 2. The
            lexical structure captures the concrete representation of Haskell programs in text
            files.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This report proceeds bottom-up with respect to Haskell’s syntactic structure.</p>
        <p>The chapters not mentioned above are Chapter 6, which describes the standard built-in
          datatypes and classes in Haskell, and Chapter 7, which discusses the I/O facility in
          Haskell (i.e. how Haskell programs communicate with the outside world). Also, there are
          several chapters describing the Prelude, the concrete syntax, literate programming, the
          specification of derived instances, and pragmas supported by most Haskell compilers.</p>
        <p>Examples of Haskell program fragments in running text are given in typewriter font:</p>
        <code class="segment">
        let x = 1<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;z = x+y<br/>
        in  z+1
      </code>
        <p>“Holes” in program fragments representing arbitrary pieces of Haskell code are written in
          italics, as in if <i>e1</i> then <i>e2</i> else <i>e3</i>. Generally the italicized names
          are mnemonic, such as <i>e</i> for expressions, <i>d</i> for declarations, <i>t</i> for
          types, etc.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="The_Haskell_Kernel">
        <header>The Haskell Kernel</header>
        <p>Haskell has adopted many of the convenient syntactic structures that have become popular
          in functional programming. In this Report, the meaning of such syntactic sugar is given by
          translation into simpler constructs. If these translations are applied exhaustively, the
          result is a program written in a small subset of Haskell that we call the Haskell
          <i>kernel</i>.
        </p>
        <p>Although the kernel is not formally specified, it is essentially a slightly sugared
          variant of the lambda calculus with a straightforward denotational semantics. The
          translation of each syntactic structure into the kernel is given as the syntax is
          introduced. This modular design facilitates reasoning about Haskell programs and provides
          useful guidelines for implementors of the language.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Values_and_Types">
        <header>Values and Types</header>
        <p>An expression evaluates to a <i>value</i> and has a static <i>type</i>. Values and types
          are not mixed in Haskell. However, the type system allows user-defined datatypes of
          various sorts, and permits not only parametric polymorphism (using a traditional
          Hindley-Milner type structure) but also <i>ad hoc</i> polymorphism, or <i>overloading</i>
          (using <i>type classes</i>).</p>
        <p>Errors in Haskell are semantically equivalent to ⊥ (“bottom”). Technically, they are
          indistinguishable from nontermination, so the language includes no mechanism for detecting
          or acting upon errors. However, implementations will probably try to provide useful
          information about errors. See Section 3.1.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Namespaces">
        <header>Namespaces</header>
        <p>There are six kinds of names in Haskell: those for <i>variables</i> and
          <i>constructors</i> denote values; those for <i>type variables</i>, <i>type
            constructors</i>, and <i>type classes</i> refer to entities related to the type system;
          and <i>module names</i> refer to modules. There are two constraints on naming:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Names for variables and type variables are identifiers beginning with lowercase
            letters or underscore; the other four kinds of names are identifiers beginning with
            uppercase letters.</li>
          <li>An identifier must not be used as the name of a type constructor and a class in the
            same scope.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are the only constraints; for example, <code>Int</code> may simultaneously be the
          name of a module, class, and constructor within a single scope.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Codebytes">
        <header>Codebytes</header>
        <p>Hello World</p>
        <code class="segment">main = putStrLn "Hello, world!"</code>
        <br />
        <p>Print System Info</p>
        <code class="segment">
          import System.Info<br/>
          main = do<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print os<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print arch<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print compilerName<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print compilerVersion<br/>

        <p>Print current date and time</p>
        <code>
          import Data.Time<br/>
          main = getCurrentTime >>= print
        </code>
